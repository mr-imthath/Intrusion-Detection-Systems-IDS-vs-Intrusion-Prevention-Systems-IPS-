# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) vs Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

In cybersecurity, **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** are two key defenses that protect networks from malicious activity. While they often work together, their roles are distinct.

---

## üîç IDS (Detection)
- **Analogy:** Think of IDS as a **security camera**.  
- **Function:**  
  - Monitors network traffic.  
  - Analyzes patterns.  
  - Raises alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.  
- **Limitation:** IDS does **not block attacks**‚Äîit only notifies security teams.  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è IPS (Prevention)
- **Analogy:** IPS is like a **bouncer at a club**.  
- **Function:**  
  - Inspects network traffic in real time.  
  - **Blocks malicious packets** or connections immediately.  
  - Enforces security rules automatically.  
- **Strength:** Provides **instant protection** without waiting for human action.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Why They Matter
1. **Early Detection & Visibility** ‚Äì IDS provides awareness of threats before they escalate.  
2. **Active Defense** ‚Äì IPS minimizes the attack window by stopping threats instantly.  
3. **Layered Security** ‚Äì Together, IDS + IPS ensure **visibility + prevention**, strengthening defense-in-depth strategies.
